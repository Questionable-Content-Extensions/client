* Make use of angular-translate to offer the website with translations
    - Translate the text on the page, sure, but also consider the more awesome
      possibility: Translating the comics themselves:
        o Make use of image tagging/overlays, kind of like a mix between YouTube's
          annotations and Flickr's photo-tagging. Code for inspiration here:

* Cast Member (+possibly location/storyline) information dialog:
    - Click on a cast member in the navigation, get information about them, like
      how many comics they've appeared in, who they appear most often with,
      how long ago it's been since they've been seen + other interesting
      statistics that I'm sure I'll think of someday.
