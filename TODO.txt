* Make use of angular-translate to offer the website with translations
    - Translate the text on the page, sure, but also consider the more awesome
      possibility: Translating the comics themselves:
        o Make use of image tagging/overlays, kind of like a mix between YouTube's
          annotations and Flickr's photo-tagging. Code for inspiration here:
          http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1839-jquery-photo-tagger-plugin-for-flickr-style-photo-tagging.htm
* Cast Member (+possibly location/storyline) information dialog:
    - Click on a cast member in the navigation, get information about them, like
      how many comics they've appeared in, who they appear most often with,
      how long ago it's been since they've been seen + other interesting
      statistics that I'm sure I'll think of someday.
* Comic bookmarks (keep your place/make a favorite list/etc.)
* The "show all members" setting should not affect the "Edit comic data" dialog
    - Conversely, a comic without comic data should not prevent "show all members" from working
* Show proper error message dialog instead of just logging to console when web service calls fail
* Clean up the use of $scope.safeApply -- can probably be mostly solved by doing the $apply in the replaced $http service, like I assume is the case in the real $http.
* Show more details in item detail dialog. Some ideas:
    - Which other cast members are most often seen with this one?
    - Which location(s) are they most often seen in?
    - Frequency of apperance (common or rare, i.e. seen often or only sporadically?)
* The custom styles for coloring an item in the navigation menu should be reset on each reload so that changes made to the color doesn't require a full page refresh to take effect.
