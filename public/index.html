      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

                Hi! While this is a React project, you're not actually meant to
                open this page, as there's no "React app" website here &mdash;
                QCEXT is a browser userscript.
            </p>
            <p>If you're uncertain how to get started, here's what you do:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    You can leave the <code>npm run start</code> you (likely)
                    started to get to this page running, as the development
                    version of the userscript is coded to reload the latest
                    version when it loads on the page. If you didn't, you should
                    run <code>npm run start</code> and keep it running while
                    you're developing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run <code>npm run build</code>. This will create a file @
                    <code>&lt;project-root&gt;/dist/qc-ext-dev.user.js</code>.
                    Add this file to your browser as a userscript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That's it. You're done. Visit
                    <a href="https://questionablecontent.net/"
                        >questionablecontent.net</a
                    >
                    and start coding.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You probably also want to run Storybook when developing. Run
                <code>npm run storybook</code> and visit
                <a href="http://localhost:6006/">http://localhost:6006/</a> to
                see the qc-ext components in isolation
            </p>

      This HTML file is a template.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

      You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
