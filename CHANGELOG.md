## [Unreleased]

### Added ‚ú®

-   Add the ability to lock comic navigation to an item. Closes [#33](https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues/33)

### Fixed üêõ

-   Fix Storybook tests after upgrading from 6.5 to 7.4. Fixes [#78](https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues/78)

## [1.1.0] - 2023-09-10

### Added ‚ú®

-   Add guest comic/non-canon pills to `ComicList`
-   Add Storybook link to README
-   Added list of comics an item is featured in. Closes [#19](https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues/19)
-   Added feature and setting for whether to show the current comic's tagline as its tooltip. Closes [#47](https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues/47)
-   Added feature and setting for being able to navigate to random comics by item. Closes [#20](https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues/20)

### Changed üîß

-   Upgraded all dependencies to their latest versions and made the necessary changes to make things work the same as before

### Fixed üêõ

-   Don't show "last strip" button in item navigation bar when said strip is the current strip
-   The logic for which exclusion setting takes precedence was backwards, so if you had set both "skip non-canon comics" and "skip guest comics," it would only skip guest comics, but not non-canon comics. Fixes [#36](https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues/36)
-   Single-frame flicker at the end of dialog close animation removed. Fixes [#70](https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues/70)

## [1.0.0][] - 2023-09-09

> Hello! It has once again been a while, but this time, it's a big one! I've been meaning to do it for a long time, but I finally got around to rewrite the extension from scratch using React as the framework rather than AngularJS v1. While I was at it, I also updated/upgraded everything else about the script that I could, and it's much more modern and user friendly now.
>
> Since this is a rewrite, the change log below will be mostly _added_ features rather than changed or fixed ones. Old features that have been migrated into the new version won't be mentioned unless changed significantly in the rewrite.

### Added ‚ú®

-   Add Storybookjs
-   Added `GoToComicDialog` for choosing a specific comic from a list
-   Added ko-fi donation link in bottom of `SettingsDialog`

### Changed üîß

-   In coordination with the server, the API has been optimized to transfer a lot less data in each request.
-   Make `debug` logging dynamic rather than chosen at startup

### Fixed üêõ

-   Make `shortcut` take-over code work properly everywhere

### Removed üóë

-   Removed small/large ribbon setting; ribbon is always small now.

## [0.6.2][] - 2022-08-31

> It's been a while! And this release isn't really one of improvement, but rather necessity. For the longest time, the Questionable Content Extensions has used Heroku's free plan as its backend, because this is a hobby project, and I don't really have the means to pay for dedicated hosting and bandwidth for it, as I make no money off this project, and I don't want it to be a financial burden. [Heroku/Salesforce has finally decided to remove their free tier](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter), which is neither surprising nor unexpected, but that naturally means that I have to use a different solution.
>
> For the time being, I'm going to go back to self-hosting, as I did before I discovered Heroku and switched to it. We'll just have to see whether it makes an impact on my costs or not. In a more positive turn of events, the self-hosted server appears to have much better performance than Heroku did, so that's a plus.
>
> Just in case someone's feeling generous or want to demonstrate gratitude for this thing I've made, I'm just going to leave this here as well. üòä

### Changed üîß

-   Format files according to Prettier standard.
-   Better handling of error communicating with server
-   Accept colors with and without `#` prefix
-   Run `dist` with the build script

### Fixed üêõ

-   Fix field spelling

## [0.6.1][] - 2019-12-08

### Fixed üêõ

-   Better fix for missing sidebar. More idiomatic fix for Issue [#37](https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues/37). It uses jQuery within the proper file, just before adding the sidebar base. It also directly tests the DOM to see if the "small-2" column is missing, rather than just guessing using the URL. Fixes [#37](https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues/37)

## [0.6.0][] - 2019-03-08

> This release, like the previous one, has been mostly about code quality and features for editors and me, the developer. I'm hoping that I can now start putting in more features for the end-user as we move towards version 0.7. If you have ideas for new features, or you have any problems with the extension as it is, don't hesitate to [tell us about them][issues]! While I have quite a lot of ideas left to implement, I'd also love to implement ideas that aren't just my own.

-   Update copyright year
-   Rename ComicDataControllerBase to EventHandlingControllerBase
-   Separate out code checking from building. To speed up building simple fixes and amendments (Flow and ESLint are slow)

### Changed üîß

-   Turn off maximum line length code style requirement
-   Don't reinvent the wheel ‚Äî use Angular's date formatting. Also, since the date formatting is now done at the template level rather than on comic data load, changing the 12h/24h time setting doesn't require a full refresh of the comic data in order to reformat.

(Also, fixes [#8](https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues/8) for real this time.)

-   Show different messages for different kinds of items

### Fixed üêõ

-   Don't interfere with Firefox' Alt+Left/Alt+Right navigation. Fixes [#2](https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues/2).
