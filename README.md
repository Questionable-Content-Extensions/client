# Questionable Content Extensions Userscript [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client) [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.svg)](http://gruntjs.com/)

## Getting Started

### Using the usercript

In Firefox or Chrome, install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
You can then test the userscript by installing by going [here](https://questionablextensions.net/releases/qc-ext.latest.user.js).

### Building the userscript

To build this project, you can make use of a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, which will take care of setting the build environment up for you (recommended<sup>[[1](#footnote-recommended)]</sup>) or, you can install the build environment on your own computer.

#### Building using Docker

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) if you don't already have it on your system. (If you're not familiar with Docker from before, reading the [Getting Started](https://www.docker.com/get-started) documentation is recommended to get a feel for what it is about.)

Once Docker is installed, clone this repository, then run the build.ps1 file. If you're not using Powershell, run the commands from build.ps1 manually in your own shell.

After having run the commands, you should have files created at `dist\qc-ext.user.js`. This file can be opened in Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey directly.

Whenever you've made changes and want to incorporate them into the user script, simply run the build script again.

#### Building on your own computer

This project requires [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/). Install it on your system in whatever manner is appropriate for your operating system, clone this repository, then run the following commands in the repository directory:

```shell
npm install     # To install all the grunt plugins we use
npm build       # To build our script
```

After having run the commands above, you should have files created at `dist\qc-ext.user.js`. This file can be opened in Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey directly.

Whenever you've made changes and want to incorporate them into the user script, simply run `grunt` again.
